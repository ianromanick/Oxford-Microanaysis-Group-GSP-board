Repository to document Oxford Microanalysis Group "GSP Board." These boards were found at an electronics reseller in Hillsboro, Oregon. I purchased them because each board has a TMS34010. Someday, I hope to get a TIGA board for PC or an A2410 board for Amiga. Having spare TMS34010 chips on hand is potentially useful.

Pictures are in the pics directory, and ROM dumps will eventually be in the roms directory.
